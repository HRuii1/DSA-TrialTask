# DSA-TrialTask

I use a jupyter notebook for this task. To run the project:\
1. Clone the repository
2. Open the `trial_task_dsa_lab.ipynb` notebook.
3. Ensure the dataset that you want to analysis are placed in a directory accessible to the notebook
4. In the second cell of the notebook, trial is a placeholder for the actual dataset trial number. Replace '02' with the trial number you wish to analyze.
5. Run each cell
